## PWA iOS Splash screens for Sketch

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is designed to look and behave in a way similar to a native application, scaled to fit the entire screen on iOS.

You create unique splash screens for each individual device.

### Requirements

- Tested using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) 52.5

Manually place the file in the following location to have it included in your templates in Sketch:

	~Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Templates
	
Or you can simply double click on the file and it will open in the app.

### Generating images

When you've created all the images, export as PNG x1 - the image sizes have been created to suit the retina screens (x2).

More information from Apple on creating and configuring [Web Applications](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html).

### What if I don't have Sketch?

There is a `blank_images` folder with PNG files ready for you to modify in your preferred image editor.
